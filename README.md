# Portofolio
### Hi, I'm Tok Se Ka, a final‑year Informatics student at Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta. I enjoy turning ideas into products—websites, mobile apps, data tools, and machine‑learning models.

## At a glance
- Independent Study – Machine Learning (Dicoding 2025) → built end‑to‑end ML pipelines in Python for image and tabular data, covering data wrangling, modelling, and interactive visualisation.
- Teaching Assistant (×2)
  - Object‑Oriented Programming – JavaScript focus
  - Web‑Based Information Systems – Next.js focus
- Mentor, Kelompok Studi Pemrograman (KSP) for two terms, teaching C basics and Java OOP principles.
- Built and deployed two self‑funded websites (HTML/CSS/JS + Supabase + Midtrans payments) for real‑world clients.
- Currently exploring Next.js (App Router & React Server Components), Laravel 10, React Native Expo, and applied AI.
