# Portofolio
### Hi, I'm Tok Se Ka, a final‑year Informatics student at Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta. I enjoy turning ideas into products—websites, mobile apps, data tools, and machine‑learning models.

## At a glance
- Independent Study – Machine Learning (Dicoding 2025) → built end‑to‑end ML pipelines in Python for image and tabular data, covering data wrangling, modelling, and interactive visualisation.
- Teaching Assistant (×2)
  - Object‑Oriented Programming – JavaScript focus
  - Web‑Based Information Systems – Next.js focus
- Mentor, Kelompok Studi Pemrograman (KSP) for two terms, teaching C basics and Java OOP principles.
- Built and deployed two self‑funded websites (HTML/CSS/JS + Supabase + Midtrans payments) for real‑world clients.
- Currently exploring Next.js (App Router & React Server Components), Laravel 10, React Native Expo, and applied AI.

## Project Catalog
#### Valentine Web App - [Live Demo](https://gakbisanolak.netlify.app/)
I built a fun and interactive web-based service that allows users to create personalized Valentine’s webpages with a unique payment model.
#### Web-Based Clicker Game - [Live Demo](https://gebukdontol.netlify.app/) 
GebukDontol is a web-based clicker game inspired by Popcat, where users can repeatedly tap the screen to collect points and compete on a global leaderboard.
#### Data Analysis with Python - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TokSeKa-uajy/Proyek-Analisis-Data.git) | [Live Demo](https://tokseka-uajy-proyekanalisisdata-dashboard-ywuaw8.streamlit.app/)
As part of my independent study, I built a data analysis dashboard using Python and Streamlit to visualize and explore datasets through interactive charts and statistical summaries.
#### Intro to Machine Learning - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TokSeKa-uajy/Belajar-Machine-Learning-untuk-Pemula.git)
As part of my independent study, I built a beginner-friendly machine learning project that covers both clustering and classification tasks using Python. The project includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, K-Means clustering, Decision Tree classification, and model evaluation — all implemented and visualized in Google Colab Notebook using scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
#### Sentiment Analysis Project - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TokSeKa-uajy/Proyek-Analisis-Sentimen.git)  
This project involves building a sentiment analysis model using self-scraped data (≥3,000 samples) from platforms like PlayStore and social media. It includes feature extraction, data labeling, and machine learning classification, with a testing accuracy benchmark of at least 85%.
#### Image Classification Project - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TokSeKa-uajy/Proyek-Klasifikasi-Gambar.git)  
This project focuses on classifying rice grain types using a custom CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras. It involves training on over 1,000 images from a Kaggle dataset, with dataset splits, accuracy tracking, and exporting models in SavedModel, TF-Lite, and TensorFlow.js formats. 
#### Atma Gym (Website - React+Laravel) - [Backend Repo](https://github.com/TokSeKa-uajy/PW_B_4_Laravel.git) - [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/TokSeKa-uajy/PW_B_4_React.git) 
Collaboratively developed a gym management website as a two-person team, using React.js for the frontend and Laravel for the backend. The system communicates via RESTful APIs, enabling features such as user registration, class scheduling, and membership management.
